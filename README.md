## Map file syntax

In addition to the explanation below, you can look at `example.map` to see an example of a map file.

### First line

The first line must contain two doubles to store the starting player coordinates.
These doubles must be separated by a non-digit, non-period, non-newline character.

### Map cells

The following lines are just a two dimensional array of digits from 0-7.
These digits represent cells on the map and their value represents their state.
The meaning of the values of the cells is listed below.

#### Map cell states

`0`: empty, no wall

`1`: white wall

`2`: red wall

`3`: green wall

`4`: yellow wall

`5`: blue wall

`6`: magenta wall

`7`: cyan wall

Notice how the colors resemble the color palette of a 3 bit color terminal.
